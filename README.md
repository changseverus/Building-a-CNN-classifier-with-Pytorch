# ConvNet classifier with Pytorch from scratch

Convolutional neural network has been proven to be really effective in computer vision tasks, and related opensource packages and 
research have been exploding in the recent years.

This notebook present a simple demonstration of how to build a basic convolutional neural network image classifier using Pytorch.
